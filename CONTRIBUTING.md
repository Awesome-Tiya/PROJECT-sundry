- Keep PRs focused and small where possible 
- If you're adding a new feature, briefly describe it in the PR 
- If there is a different page which you are making, than the existing one, inside [Designs](./frontend/src/assets/designs/)! put the screenshot of the design you made, or the screenshot of the page you made should be fine also
